# Brum Brew Fest Tracker

Tracker for Brum Brew Fest venues

## Running locally

### Dev environment

The easiest way to run the app is with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and
[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

Copy the contents of `setup` to the root of the repo, customise with environment
variables and secrets as discussed below, and then run:

```sh
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up
```

The dev compose file spins up a Postgres database initialised with the
tables, types, functions, and venue data.
You can interact with this db using `psql` in the db container:

```sh
docker exec -it brum-brew-fest-db-1 psql -U bbf -d bbf
```

### Prod environment

You can also emulate the prod environment by running:

```sh
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up
```

When using the prod compose file you will need to provide your own Postgres db,
set up using the scripts in `db/scripts`.
